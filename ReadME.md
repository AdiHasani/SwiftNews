## More Info

I got a job assigment to make the Hacker News Interface more user friendly using the API from newsAPI.org and in this repo you can find the result of my passionated work.<br />
I have writen it mostly with JavaScript ES6 and also i have used async/await from ES8 the styling is with CSS3 and markup is HTML5.
This version will not work in every browser and in some will behave strange. Works perfectly with Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Falkon and Maxthon.<br />
After I will implement all the ideas I will make the same project using WebPack and Babel so will work perfectly with 99% of browsers.<br /><br />
